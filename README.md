LCM Drupal 8 Scaffolding
========================
[![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/LastCallMedia/Drupal-Scaffold.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/LastCallMedia/Drupal-Scaffold)
[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/lastcall/drupal-scaffold/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/lastcall/drupal-scaffold)

This is a boilerplate Drupal 8 build that bundles some standard tools to make it a good starting point for an enterprise scale Drupal build.  It is conceptually similar to [drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold), but it has a much simpler (and more manual) Composer setup, and includes additional tools.  For additional information on this project, see the [2016 Badcamp presentation slides](https://2016.badcamp.net/sites/default/files/session-files/FirstClassDevelopmentWorkflow.pdf)

Starting a New Project
----------------------
- [ ] Use composer to create a new project, starting from this repository as a template:
    ```bash
    composer create-project lastcall/drupal-scaffold PROJECTNAME
    ```
- [ ] Bring up the Docker containers and enter the Drupal container.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d drupal
    docker-compose exec drupal /bin/bash
    ```
- [ ] From the repository root (`/var/www` inside the Drupal container), install NPM and composer dependencies:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    composer install
    ```
- [ ] Visit the Drupal site in your browser to install Drupal and continue.  The default URL will be `http://localhost:8080`.

See the [scaffold documentation](docs/scaffold.md) for next steps.

## Stop here!

Everything below this line applies to scaffold projects that are already set up. The section below will be the start of your project's README.

Setting Up for Local Development
--------------------------------
Before you begin, you must have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your local machine.  For installation instructions, see the [Docker documentation](/docs/tools/docker.md).

1. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) this repository.
2. If you haven't created and [set your Pantheon machine token](/docs/recipes/setting-machine-token.md), do that now.
3. [Start](/docs/tools/docker.md#Running) the Docker environment and shell in:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d drupal
    docker-compose exec drupal bash
    ```
3. Install [Composer](/docs/tools/composer.md#Running) dependencies:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```
4. Install [NPM](/docs/tools/npm.md#Running) dependencies:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
5. Run `composer site:import` to pull down and import a copy of the site's database.

See the documentation(/docs) for more information on how to use the tools and how to use this project. For more information on the Docker stack, see the [Docker documenation](/docs/tools/docker.md).
